It includes deterministic references to <a href=\"/situations/anxiety\">the anxiety situation</a>, <a href=\"/prayer-points/anxiety\">anxiety prayer points</a>, and the TourLeadForm to keep the commerce funnel attached to the experience.</p><p>The middle section describes how embedded verse intelligence pearls (places, situations, prayer points) appear under the “Verse Intelligence Block” and emphasizes the semantic search tool, which is accessible via <a href=\"/semantic-search\">/semantic-search</a>.</p><p>The conclusion invites the reader to bookmark the verse page, listen to the audio guide, and sign up for the newsletter that ties to the 30 000 € affiliate target.</p>",
