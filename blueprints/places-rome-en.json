  "content": "<p>Rome’s detail text showcases verses about witness, persecution, and mission, aligning with the Verse Intelligence Block that covers perseverance and courage. The introduction points to <a href=\"/bible-verses-for/rome\">Rome verses</a>, links to Rome-related situations (boldness, justice), and gives the TourLeadForm as the affiliate CTA for ethically guided pilgrimages.</p><p>The body recommends prayer points for witnesses (<a href=\"/prayer-points/witness\">witness prayer points</a>), ties Rome back to Jerusalem and Nazareth itineraries, and includes a semantic-search mention so readers explore similar passages before booking.</p><p>The conclusion thanks visitors for stewarding the story, encourages sharing with their networks, and reaffirms that the tours support the €30K monthly revenue goal.</p>",
